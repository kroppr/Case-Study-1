1.	Split County Covid data into 9 regions, resulting in 9 25x130 matrices.

2.	Use MatLab std to take standard deviation of each region, resulting in 9 1x130 vectors. Concatenate these, resulting in a 9x130 matrix composed of the 
	standard deviation for each time point for each region.

3.	Using loops, create a new 9x130 matrix. Any given element in this matrix is a RATIO. The numerator is the standard deviation of that region at that time point. 
	The denominator is the SUM of the STDVs of all other regions at that time point. Element (1,1) is the STDV of region 1 at the first time point, divided by the 
	sum of all other STDVs at that time point, here those being for regions 2-9. If a STDV is small, that means the region is relatively consistent at that point. 
	If the STDVs of the other regions are large at that same time point, then that means this region is consistent, while others are not, making this an ideal index 
	to differentiate the region in question. Both those two factors make the ratio SMALLER.

4.	Extract minimum indices from the step 3 matrix, these being the best markers for differentiation.

5.	Generate an identity matrix, but it only has 0’s at all points not corresponding to our target indices.

a.	If the ith index is targeted via steps 4 and 3, then element ixi in the identity matrix will be a 1. Any index not selected will be 0 along its entire row 
	and column.

6.	Multiply the data by this odd identity matrix, and the result will be the elimination of all data except the “marker” points.

7.	Run kmeans on majority of data. Use matlab “mode” to see which centroids correspond to which regions. Produce a “ref” vector containing this info.

8.	Input centroids from step 7 and run kmeans on test data. See how results compare to “ref”.
